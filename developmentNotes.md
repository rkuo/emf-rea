# Model Driven Engineering

* use REA as economic exchange model, create an EMF and an UML models.
* use BPMN as process flow model.
* define operation and orchestration tasks.

## REA model

* Agent has certain levels of Custody of a Resource. The custodyship of an Agent (person or system) allows Agent to exchange the custodyship with other Agent's Resource.
* A Resource has economic value; which can be decremented or incremented. Resource may be a product or a service. Service proides intangible utility, generally, the facility or platform used to produce the utility remains to the owner. 
* An economic exchange is an economic Event between Agents; which results an economic Commitment.
* A Commitment is fulfiled by execute some types of economic Process.
* An economic process changes Resource or Custody of a Resource. 

All entities may be either internal or external of enterprice. Event has duality, which trigger different economic Commitment for different Agents. 

Economic exchange occurs on certain platform, which can belong to an Agnet, e.g. Amazon's shopping site, or a third party, e.g. New York Stock Exchange.
